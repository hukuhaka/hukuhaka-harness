# Backlog

Capture items to `.claude/backlog.md` with codebase research. I/O is handled by bundled scripts; research and priority decisions stay in this session.

## Rules

- Do NOT spawn any agents via Agent tool. Handle everything directly
- Do NOT use Read/Glob to load .claude/ docs — invoke `scripts/preflight.sh`
- Do NOT use Edit/Write to add the entry — invoke `scripts/append-entry.py`
- Research (codebase Grep/Read) stays prompt-driven — script can't replace judgment

## Options

- `--priority <high|medium|low>`: Set priority explicitly. If omitted, auto-judge then confirm via AskUserQuestion

## Flow

Execute these 6 steps sequentially.

### 1. Parse

Extract description text and `--priority` option from `$ARGUMENTS`.

### 2. Pre-flight

Load existing context via the bundled script:

```
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/backlog/scripts/preflight.sh
```

The script cats `.claude/backlog.md` (required), `.claude/map.md`, `.claude/design.md` (if present). If backlog.md is missing, the script exits 1 and you must STOP and tell the user to run `/hukuhaka-project-mapper:map-init` first.

### 3. Duplicate Check

Run the duplicate finder against the candidate description:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/backlog/scripts/find-duplicates.py "<description>"
```

The script reports any existing entries with token-overlap ≥ 0.20 (Jaccard). If matches are found, use AskUserQuestion to ask whether to proceed (new entry) or stop because the existing item already covers it. There is no in-place merge path — backlog.md is script-written only (Write/Edit are blocked); if the user wants the existing entry reworded, show the exact line for them to update manually and stop.

### 4. Research

Investigate the codebase to find relevant code. See [research-guide.md](references/research-guide.md) for methodology.

- Maximum 3 search rounds (Grep or Glob)
- Result: `file:symbol` anchors + context (2 lines max per anchor)
- If no code target found (pure idea), skip anchors

### 5. Priority

If `--priority` was provided, use it. Otherwise:
1. Auto-judge priority based on research findings and description
2. Present recommendation via AskUserQuestion with options: High, Medium, Low
3. Use confirmed priority

### 6. Append + Report

Append the entry via the bundled script:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/backlog/scripts/append-entry.py \
  --priority <high|medium|low> \
  --entry '`file:symbol`: description' \
  [--context "Related: file1, file2"] \
  [--behavior "Current: 1-line summary"]
```

Use `--context` and `--behavior` only when research yielded concrete file:symbol anchors. For idea-only entries (no code target), pass `--entry "description"` without backticks.

The script appends under `## Planned > ### {Priority} Priority` and is idempotent. Display its stdout verbatim as the completion report.
