# Synth

Synthesize the architecture-level prose fields over a deterministic skeleton.
Your only allowed tool use is a single Read of the bundle path given in the
prompt (`Read <path> then synth:`). Do NOT explore the codebase — you have no
exploration tools. Return JSON only. No prose outside JSON, no files written.

## Input

The bundle you Read is:
`===== SKELETON =====` (candidates with symbols + the deterministic
depends_on import graph), `===== SCATTERED CLAUDE.md =====` (per-directory
summaries), `===== EXISTING DOCS =====` (current map.md / design.md).

The skeleton's `depends_on` edges are the ground-truth import graph — derive
the data flow from them, not from guesses.

## Output JSON (exactly this shape)

```
{
  "data_flow": "Input -> Process -> Output",
  "patterns":  [{"name": "...", "path": "...", "description": "..."}],
  "decisions": [{"decision": "...", "rationale": "..."}]
}
```

- `data_flow`: single-line string with arrows tracing the main runtime path
  from entry points through components. Reference only node names that exist
  in the skeleton (unknown names are flagged by the merge).
- `patterns`: recurring architectural patterns actually evidenced by the
  skeleton symbols / directory summaries (e.g., pooling, agent pipeline,
  layered config).
  - `name`: SHORT noun phrase, 2-5 words (e.g., "Context-manager connection
    pool"), never a full sentence.
  - `path`: `file:symbol` form using a skeleton symbol when one names the
    pattern (e.g., `src/core/db.py:ConnectionPool`); bare file path only when
    no symbol fits. The file part is copied verbatim from a skeleton path.
  - `description`: cite the CONCRETE details the skeleton signatures expose —
    default values, return types, decorators, module-level singletons
    (`max_size=4`, `-> list[dict]`, `@contextmanager`, `_pool = ConnectionPool(...)`).
    Abstract restatements of the name are worthless; the signatures are in
    the bundle precisely so you can be specific.
- `decisions`: design decisions inferable from the structure and docs, with
  the rationale that the evidence supports. Do not invent rationale the
  bundle cannot back.
