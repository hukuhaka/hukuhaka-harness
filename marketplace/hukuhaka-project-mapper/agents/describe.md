# Describe

Fill in prose descriptions over a deterministic skeleton. In standard mode
your only tool use is a single Read of the bundle path given in the prompt;
in scatter mode the extract is inline and you make no tool calls. Do NOT
explore the codebase — you have no exploration tools, and the structure
(names, paths, depends_on) is already decided by the skeleton. Return JSON
only. No prose outside JSON, no files written.

## Standard Mode

When the prompt is `Read <path> then describe:`, Read that path once — it is
the context bundle:
`===== SKELETON =====` (candidates JSON), `===== SCATTERED CLAUDE.md =====`
(per-directory summaries), `===== EXISTING DOCS =====` (current map.md /
design.md).

For every candidate in the skeleton's `candidates.entry_points`,
`candidates.components`, and `candidates.directories`:

1. Write a 1-sentence `description`. Source priority:
   1. the candidate's `skeleton_doc` (docstring / header — refine, don't parrot)
   2. the scattered CLAUDE.md sentence for that file
   3. the existing map.md line for that path
   Use the `symbols` list to make the sentence concrete (what it exposes, not
   just what it is).
2. For entry-point candidates only: set `include` — `true` if it is an actual
   user- or program-facing entry point (CLI, server app, orchestrator script),
   `false` if it merely matched a heuristic (a helper with a `__main__` test
   block, a library file named like an entry point). When unsure, prefer
   `false` — pruned candidates are kept as components, not lost.

Output JSON (exactly this shape):

```
{
  "entry_points": [{"path": "...", "description": "...", "include": true}],
  "components":   [{"path": "...", "description": "..."}],
  "directories":  [{"path": "...", "description": "..."}]
}
```

Rules:

- `path` MUST be copied verbatim from the skeleton. Never invent, normalize,
  or extend paths — anything not in the skeleton is dropped by the merge.
- Every skeleton candidate gets a description. Do not skip entries.
- Descriptions are 1 sentence, concrete, present tense.

## Scatter Mode

When the prompt starts with `scatter:`, the prompt body is a deterministic
per-directory extract (`===== SCATTER EXTRACT =====`: child dirs, file list,
first 20 lines of each file). Produce the folder summary JSON:

```
{
  "stats": {"files_scanned": N, "queries_run": 0},
  "folder_path": "path/to/folder",
  "folder_name": "folder",
  "purpose": "one-line folder purpose",
  "files": [{"name": "file.ext", "purpose": "one-line description"}],
  "children": ["child_dir"]
}
```

`files` and `children` MUST list exactly what the extract shows — no
additions, no omissions. Only `purpose` sentences are yours to write.
