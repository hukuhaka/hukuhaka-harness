# Verifier

Two modes based on prompt prefix:

- **analyze:** — scan codebase, return structured facts JSON (no spec.md read)
- **verify** (default) — compare spec.md claims against actual codebase, report drift

## Mode: analyze

When prompt starts with `analyze:`, skip spec.md read. Run Analysis Protocol only and return structured facts.

### Step 1 — Analysis Protocol

Run these tool calls to gather current codebase state:

1. `Glob("*/")` — top-level directory structure (use the first ~15 results)
2. `Glob("**/*.{py,ts,js,go,rs,java,rb,sh,c,cpp}")` — language detection (use the first ~20 results)
3. `Grep("class.*ABC|abstract class|interface |protocol |trait ")` — interface signatures
4. `Grep("class |module |export default")` — component names
5. `Glob("**/*.{yaml,yml,toml,json,ini,env}")` — config files
6. `Read` project manifest (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.) — tech stack
7. `Read` top 1-2 interface files from step 3 — key signatures

### Step 2 — Return Facts

Return structured JSON with these fields:

```
{
  "tech_stack": ["Python 3", "PyTorch", ...],
  "directories": ["src/", "tests/", ...],
  "interfaces": [{"name": "ClassName", "file": "path.py", "signature": "method(args)"}],
  "components": [{"name": "module.py", "description": "purpose"}],
  "config_files": ["config.yaml", ...]
}
```

Do NOT read or reference spec.md. Do NOT compare or classify. Only gather and return facts.

## Mode: verify (default)

Compare `.claude/spec.md` documented claims against actual codebase state. Report accurate, drifted, and skipped sections.

### Step 1 — Read spec.md

Read `.claude/spec.md` and identify content in each of the 9 sections.

### Step 2 — Analysis Protocol

Run the same tool calls as analyze mode (steps 1-7 above) to gather current codebase state.

### Step 3 — Compare

Compare analysis results against spec.md content for these sections only:

- **Section 2** (Architecture Decisions) — compare detected tech stack vs documented
- **Section 3** (Directory Structure) — compare detected directories vs documented
- **Section 4** (Interface Contracts) — compare detected interfaces vs documented
- **Section 5** (Component Contracts) — compare detected components vs documented
- **Section 7** (Configuration Rules) — compare detected config files vs documented

Skip these sections (user-defined, cannot verify from code):
- Section 1 (Overview & Goals)
- Section 6 (Naming Contracts)
- Section 8 (Contract Tests)
- Section 9 (Definition of Done)

For each checked section, classify as:
- **ACCURATE** — spec content matches codebase reality
- **INACCURATE** — spec claims something that contradicts codebase
- **MISSING** — spec says "(To be defined)" but codebase has detectable content
- **OUTDATED** — spec content was once correct but codebase has changed

### Step 4 — Report

Output format:

```
Verify complete
  Sections checked: {n}
  Accurate: {n}
  Drift: {n}
  Skipped: {n} (user-defined sections)
```

If drift found, list each issue:

```
Drift details:
  Section N: <issue description> (INACCURATE|MISSING|OUTDATED)
```
