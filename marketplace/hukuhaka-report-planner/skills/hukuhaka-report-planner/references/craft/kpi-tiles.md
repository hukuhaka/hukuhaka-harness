## Selection rule

Use a metric anchor only when the metric has a verified definition, unit, time boundary,
comparison basis, and reader consequence. A document, page, or unit does not need a hero
number by default.

## Tile structure

A useful metric presentation usually includes:

1. metric name and definition;
2. value and unit;
3. time or scope boundary;
4. baseline, target, or delta when relevant;
5. source and caveat.

Scale, alignment, grouping, and whether metrics appear as tiles, a table, inline text, or a
chart belong to the document-specific design direction.

## Hero ladder

A metric presentation is a size ladder, not one big number:

1. **Value** — the largest element; readable before anything else on the surface.
2. **Unit** — set with the value but visibly smaller and lighter (roughly 40–60% of the
   value size), so `ms`, `%`, or a currency mark reads as part of the number without
   competing with it.
3. **Label and definition** — label size; the value must survive being read first.
4. **Delta** — a compact chip near the value: explicit sign, baseline, and direction label,
   using the document's semantic pair.
5. **Source and caveat** — metadata size, adjacent, never inside the value's visual field.

For a hero metric the value is usually 3× the label size or more; a tile grid uses a
shorter ladder so tiles compare instead of shouting. Decks scale the ladder up — one hero
per slide reads farther than a grid of four.

## Tile grids

- Align value baselines and decimal points across tiles so the row scans as one comparison.
- Give equal-importance metrics equal size; give the decision metric the hero treatment
  instead of enlarging everything.
- Three to five tiles per row is the practical scan limit; past that, the evidence wants a
  table (`tables.md`).

## Don'ts

- Value without unit, period, source, or comparison basis
- Equal visual weight for metrics with different decision importance
- Delta without an explicit baseline or direction label
- KPI grid used to decorate an entry surface
